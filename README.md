#Is it UDS Yet?

So, for those of you that don't know, there is a little site known as [is it christmas yet?](http://isitchristmas.com/).

The site is simple - some would say too simple.

the whole idea is that it tells you, quickly, "Is it UDS yet?!".

And it does this very nicely.

Credits:

[Marco Ceppi](http://marcoceppi.com/) for two things:
 - [The domain](http://isitaudsyet.com/)
 - The CSS to make it centered, because I (james) is not a CSS guru.

Roland Taylor for telling me I'm insane, and then loving the site anyway.
